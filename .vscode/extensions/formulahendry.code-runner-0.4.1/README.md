* Stop code running
* View output in Output Window
* Set default language to run
* Select language to run
* Support REPL by running code in Integrated Terminal

## Usages

* Open code file or select code snippet in Text Editor, then use shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`, or press `F1` and then select/type `Run Code`, or right click the Text Editor and then click `Run Code` in context menu, the code will run and the output will be shown in the Output Window.

## Configuration

Make sure the interpreter PATH of each language is set in the environment variable.
You could also add entry into `code-runner.executorMap` to set the interpreter PATH.
e.g. To set the interpreter PATH for ruby and php:
```json
{
    "code-runner.executorMap": {
        "javascript": "node",
        "php": "C:\\php\\php.exe",
        "python": "python",
        "perl": "perl",
        "ruby": "C:\\Ruby23-x64\\bin\\ruby.exe",
        "go": "go run"
    }
}
```

Besides, you could set the default language to run:
```json
{
    "code-runner.defaultLanguage": "javascript"
}
```
**For the default language:** It should be set with language id defined in [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions). The languages you could set are `javascript, php, python, perl, ruby, go, lua, groovy, powershell, bat, shellscript, fsharp, csharp, vbscript, typescript, coffeescript`

Also, you could set the executor per file extension:
```json
{
    "code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension": {
        ".vbs": "cscript //Nologo"
    }
}
```

To set the the working directory:
```json
{
    "code-runner.cwd": "path/to/working/directory"
}
```

To set whether to clear previous output before each run (default is false):
```json
{
    "code-runner.clearPreviousOutput": false
}
```

To set whether to save the file before running (default is false):
```json
{
    "code-runner.saveFileBeforeRun": false
}
```

To set whether to show extra execution message like [Running] ... and [Done] ... (default is true):
```json
{
    "code-runner.showExecutionMessage": true
}
```

**[REPL support]** To set whether to run code in Integrated Terminal (only support to run whole file in Integrated Terminal, neither untitled file nor code snippet) (default is false):
```json
{
    "code-runner.runInTerminal": false
}
```

## About CWD Setting (current working directory)
1. By default, use the `code-runner.cwd` setting
2. If `code-runner.cwd` is not set and `code-runner.fileDirectoryAsCwd` is `ture`, use the directory of the file to be executed
3. If `code-runner.cwd` is not set and `code-runner.fileDirectoryAsCwd` is `false`, use the path of root folder that is open in VS Code
4. If no folder is open, use the os temp folder

## Note
* To run C# script, you need to install [scriptcs](http://scriptcs.net/)
* To run TypeScript, you need to install [ts-node](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-node)

## Telemetry data
By default, telemetry data collection is turned on to understand user behavior to improve this extension. To disable it, update the settings.json as below:
```json
{
    "code-runner.enableAppInsights": false
}
```
