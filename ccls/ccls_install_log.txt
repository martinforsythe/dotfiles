0. install llvm:
```
brew install llvm
```
then add this to ~/.zshrc and source:
```
export PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib $LDFLAGS"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include $LDFLAGS"
```

1. clone ccls repo:
```
cd ~/external_code
git clone --depth=1 --recursive https://github.com/MaskRay/ccls
cd ccls
```

2. configure cmake:
```
cmake -H. -BRelease \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin/clang++ \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm \
    -DLLVM_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/opt/llvm/include \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/manual
```

3. build release version
```
cmake --build Release
```

4. if compilation succeeds, install to INSTALL_PREFIX location
```
sudo cmake --build Release --target install
```
(sudo is needed to deal with permissions to /usr/local/manual/bin)
